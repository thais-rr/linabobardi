                <p>Lina Bo Bardi (born December 5, 1914, Rome, Italy – died March 20, 1992, São Paulo, Brazil) was an Italian-born Brazilian architect, furniture designer, set designer, journalist and activist whose work combines a Modernist sensitivity with a profound commitment to the preservation of the vernacular and a design process guided by social responsibility. Today, Bo Bardi is considered one of the most prominent and consequential Modernist architects, and her prolific body of work is appreciated for its simplicity, adherence to Modernism, and deep contemplation as to the ways in which architecture can also reflect the common, the vernacular, and the artisanal as an intrinsic part of a contemporary culture.</p>
